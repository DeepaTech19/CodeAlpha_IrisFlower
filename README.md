# Iris Flower Classification
This project uses a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into 
three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on sepal and petal dimensions.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Iris.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)  
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width  
- Target: Species

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn 

## Output
- Data visualizations (pairplot, heatmap)
- Accuracy score and classification report
- Confusion matrix for performance evaluation

## Internship Task Submission
This project was submitted as part of my internship at Code Alpha under the Data Science domain.
